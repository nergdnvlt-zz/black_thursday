    * Even workload

  ## Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):

    * Using Hound to review commits,
    * Using Waffle IO/getting comfortable with it

  ## Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
    * Feedback should be specific, actionable, and kind.

  ## Agenda to discuss project launch:
    * DTR, schedule, logical components, mapping out the iterations

  ## Ideas:
